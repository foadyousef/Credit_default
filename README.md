# Credit_default
default of credit card clients


## Project Description

The following work is an attempt to predict credit default for 30000 costumers of a bank in Taiwan. The data is courtesy of UCI machine learning data-base and can be found here.

My short-term goal is to employ an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to make predictions about the probability of credit default using the available variables. This is an ongoing effort, so please check back for more updates.
